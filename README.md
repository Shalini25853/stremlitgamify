# GamifyConnect â€“ Social Media Gamification Dashboard

GamifyConnect is a real-time engagement analytics dashboard designed to simulate user behavior on a social media platform. Built using Python, Streamlit, and Google Cloud Firestore, it tracks activities like posts, comments, likes, and shares, then awards points and badges to users using gamification logic.

While this model currently simulates 5 users for clarity, it is fully scalable. The Firestore database and analytics logic are designed to handle larger datasets and could easily support real-time analytics for hundreds of users with minimal changes.

## Features
